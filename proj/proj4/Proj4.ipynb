    "In this project, we will be investigating how different database systems handle semi-structured JSON data. In particular, we will be placing emphasis on the use of MongoDB: a database system that stores data in a construct known as documents. These documents are very similar to the JSON objects we've explored in lecture with a few differences in representation and indexing that we will explore in the following questions. In this project, we will be working with the Yelp Academic Dataset which contains a dataset of `businesses`, `reviews`, and `users`. Due to the limitations of JupyterHub and the Mongo instances we are working with, `reviews` and `users` are truncated to 7500 reviews and 1000 users. We will be using the full `businesses` dataset, however.\n",

Create a new collection called `reviews_boolean` which is the exact same as `reviews` EXCEPT there is a new field called `to_avoid` which is the string \"true\"  if the review `text` contains the words \"disgusting\", \"horrid\", \"horrible\", \"gross\", \"bad\", or \"hate\" and the string \"false\" if not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tricky task! We have not discussed creation, updates, or insertions in great detail during lecture but luckily, Mongo uses a similar approach to SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Insertions*: In order to insert into a document, you may use the functions [`review_boolean.insert_one(...)`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/) or [`review_boolean.insert_many(...)`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/). These functions take in a document or a list of documents and inserts them into the collection. \n",

These functions take in two parameters. The first specifies which documents should be modified. If the first parameter is `{}`, this indicates that all documents should be updated. However, you can put a more specific filter here if you would like. The second parameter specifies what you would like to update your field to (the [`$set`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/set/) operator may come in handy here). Recall that in our SQL model, updates are performed as `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...`. In our case, the first ellipsis corresponds to `reviews_boolean`, the second ellipsis corresponds to the second parameter of `update_*`, and the third ellipsis corresponds to the first parameter of `update_*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Creation*: We handle creation of the collection for you. But in Pymongo, creation of a collection is as simple as writing `variable_name = db[collection_name]` where db is the the Pymongo database object variable you have already created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional reminders and hints:\n",
    "- The empty collection `reviews_boolean` has already been created for you and is stored in the variable `review_boolean`\n",
    "- `review.find({})` creates an iterator that allows you to iterate over every document in `review`\n",
